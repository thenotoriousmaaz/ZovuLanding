ZOVU Website (Landing Page)

Project scaffolding for a static landing page to be built 1:1 from provided screenshots.

Structure
- `public/index.html`: Main page (hero with video placeholder, image sections in order)
- `src/styles/main.css`: Styles
- `src/js/main.js`: Small interactions (accordions, year)
- `public/assets/images`: Put all screenshots/images here

Usage
1. Open `public/index.html` in a browser.
2. Replace placeholder images in `public/assets/images` with your final assets using the same filenames used in the HTML.
3. Later we will add the hero background video by swapping the placeholder with a `<video>` element.

Deployment
Any static host works (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify). Serve the `public` directory as the site root.
